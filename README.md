SageBot: Course News Telegram Bot
SageBot is a Telegram bot designed to share course-related news and updates with students. Built using Python and Flask, it enables administrators and instructors to log in, post announcements, and view updates, which are then automatically sent to a designated Telegram chat. The bot is integrated with a MySQL database for data management.

Features
Admin & Instructor Portals: Allows separate login areas for administrators and instructors.
Post Course Updates: Admins and instructors can submit course news, including details such as the unit, instructor, and subject matter.
Automated Telegram Messaging: Sends notifications with course-related updates directly to a specified Telegram chat.
News Feed Management: Admins can view and delete previously posted news.
User Authentication: Includes registration, login, and session management for both admins and instructors.
Technologies Used
Flask: For creating the web application.
MySQL: For database management, with MySQLdb and mysql.connector libraries for interaction.
Telegram Bot API: For automated messaging.
HTML Templates: For rendering pages using Flask's render_template.
Asyncio: For asynchronous message handling in Telegram.
